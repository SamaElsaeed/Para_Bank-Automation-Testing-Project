-- Test Scenarios

-- Precondition: Account Registration
Ensures that a valid user account exists before running scenarios.
Register a new user with valid details.
Verify success message:
“Your account was created successfully. You are now logged in.”
Logout to prepare for test execution.

--Scenario 1: Login Verification
Objective: Validate login functionality with valid & invalid credentials.
Steps:
Enter valid credentials → Validate successful login.
Enter invalid credentials → Validate error message.
DDT Applied: Excel with DataProvider

--Scenario 2: Open New Account

Steps:
Navigate to Open Account → Select type + funding account.
Confirm new account number displayed.
Verify account appears in Accounts Overview.
DDT Applied:DataProvider

Login with valid credentials
Open new account with valid data
Transfer funds with valid amount
Bill payment with valid payee details

Negative Test Cases
Login with invalid credentials
Register with missing mandatory fields
Transfer with invalid/missing accounts
Bill pay with empty/invalid details

--Reporting

All test executions generate Allure Reports, which provide a clear and interactive view of test results:


Step-by-step execution logs for each test case
Automatic screenshots on failure for debugging
Detailed test history & trends (pass/fail/skip rate over time)
Scenario-wise breakdown (Login, Account Creation, Transfer, Bill Pay)
Execution time tracking for performance insights
Data-driven run details (inputs from Excel, CSV, JSON, Properties, DataProvider)

Screenshots for failures

Test history and trends
